## Objective:
Recreational marijuana is always a hotly debated subject. Through this project we wanted to understand the Impact of legalizing recreational Marijuana on the States. We will be doing an exploration on various factors like GDP, Population, Employment etc. and to draw out comparison between pre-legalization vs post-legalization years. Through our project, we aim to study and understand several facts and figures to find the answer for ourselves, is the criticism of recreational marijuana fair?
